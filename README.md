### Installing and Configuring Fb::Auth

First, add fb-auth to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fb-auth'
```
Then run `bundle install`.

Fb::Auth will require an Client ID and an Client Secret which you can obtain after registering as a developer on [Facebook for developers](https://developers.facebook.com/).

By default, Fb::Auth will look for the environment variables called `FB_CLIENT_ID` and `FB_CLIENT_SECRET`. You can put those keys in your `.bash_profile` and Fb::Auth will work.

    export FB_CLIENT_ID="YourAppID"
    export FB_CLIENT_SECRET="YourAppSecret"

## Usage

Fb::Auth#url
------------

The `url` method helps you obtain a URL where to redirect users who need to
authenticate with their Facebook account in order to use your application:

```ruby
redirect_uri = 'https://example.com/auth' # REPLACE WITH REAL ONE
Fb::Auth.new(redirect_uri: redirect_uri, scope: ["manage_pages"]).url
 # => https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=...&scope=manage_pages&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fauth
```

Note that access is requested with permission to access email, manage pages,
read insights, et cetera. See https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions

Fb::Auth#access_token
---------------------

After users have authenticated with their Facebook account, they will be
redirected to the `redirect_uri` you indicated, with an extra `code` query
parameter, e.g. `https://example.com/auth?code=1234#_=_`

The `access_token` method allows you to get a non-expiring access token of the user:

```ruby
redirect_uri = 'https://example.com/auth' # REPLACE WITH REAL ONE
code = '1234#_=_' # REPLACE WITH REAL ONE
Fb::Auth.new(redirect_uri: redirect_uri, code: code).access_token
 # => "kefjej49s82hFS@2333233222FDh66"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. If you would like to run tests for Fb::Auth, please obtain a long-term access token that manages at least one page and has permission to read your Facebook email. (set scope to include `email`, `manage_pages`, `read_insights`.) Then set the token as an environment variable:

    export FB_TEST_ACCESS_TOKEN="YourToken"

Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
